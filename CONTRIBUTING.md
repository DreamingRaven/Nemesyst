# Contibuting
## pre-contribution
Please open a relevant issue about the changes you would like to make, before you make them such that discussion can occur, and so that when it comes to pull requesting you are not disapointed by possible rejection due to the addition of undesirable, unwanted, or subpar code.

## to contribute
Please open a pull request and link both the afformentioned issue to this pull request and vice versa so that the discussions can be associated.

## standards
This will be slowly added to over time to encompass any quirks that are deemed undesirable or inconsistent, although I realise the existing code base has certain neuroticeyes too.

* indentation must become 4 spaces without tab characters to maintain consistencey.
* if statements are prefered to be in the format "if(condition):" as opposed to "if condition:" for clarity and consistencey in the case of multiple conditions. 
* it is strongly advised that you use autopep8 or packages like atom-beautify to maintain consistency where possible.
