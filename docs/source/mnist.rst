Full |mnist|_ Example
=====================

|mnist|_ is a popular well known dataset for evaluating machine learning models. It has been effectively solved at this point, but it is still a good starting point for getting to know how Nemesyst works, and to be able to show people how to use Nemesyst in practice.
It is also relatively clean so there is little pre-processing that is required other than turning it into a directly usable form.

The dataset will be downloaded for you by the cleaning module.
