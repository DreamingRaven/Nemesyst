\begin{abstract}
\pfName\ is a deep learning framework that is built above and agnostic of any single node deep learning framework such as tensorflow, keras, pytorch. Our \pfName\ implementation uses databases along with model sequentialisation in python to allow models to be fed unique and transformed data at the point of need, along with facilitating near real-time application, and making those models available for further training or use at any node which currently has access to the database simultaneously. Further we show how \pfName\ implementation can achieve compelling performance in several different scenarios and real world problems, while still being malleable for on demand adjustments.
